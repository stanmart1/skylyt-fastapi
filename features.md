👉 Essentially, your car hire admin dashboard should let you:

2. Manage the fleet (cars, availability, maintenance).
3. Control bookings & payments smoothly.
4. Handle customers, staff, and compliance efficiently.

Do you want me to design two separate dashboards like I suggested for hotels:
1. Admin (you, business owner/manager)
2. Partners (drivers/fleet owners if you allow third-party cars)
This would give clarity on what each side should see.
